#### Perception, Learning, and Navigation
<p align="center"><img src="images/logo_LoWi_1.png" height="220">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="images/Barakuda.png" height="220"></p>

This workshop will discuss core challenges and new solutions in **perception, learning and navigation** for autonomous robots operating over long terms in the wild, complex and unstructured environments.
With robotics applications in the wild broadening from environmental monitoring and agriculture to autonomous driving and disaster relief, the requirement for long-term robust, adaptive, and intelligent systems becomes essential.
This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners to share new technologies in sensor processing, scene understanding, mapping, localization, and machine learning to address the unique demands of long-term operations in the wild, including varying terrain, adverse weather, dynamic lighting conditions, and seasonal changes.
Our goal is to foster collaboration and move toward new frontiers in robust multimodal perception, self-supervised learning, online / continual / lifelong learning, simulation-to-reality transfer, and explainable AI to enable safe, reliable and long-term autonomous robots in the wild.
This workshop will feature presentations, papers, and interactive discussion by leading experts, highlighting recent developments and future research directions for enhanced long-term performance of robotic systems in the wild.

## Venue

VIECON (formerly Messe Wien), Vienna, Austria.

## Call for papers

The workshop will cover a range of topics, including but not limited to:
* Long-term autonomy, persistent mapping, and online/continual/lifelong learning in ever-changing environments.
* Robust perception in harsh and dynamic conditions in the wild.
* Sensor fusion for robust long-term state estimation and scene understanding.
* Self-supervised/unsupervised/weakly-supervised learning in LoWi.
* Terrain classification and traversability analysis in LoWi.
* Sim-to-real transfer and domain adaptation in LoWi.
* Foundational models and their applications in LoWi.
* Safety, long-term reliability, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability in LoWi.
* Novel sensors, long-term or multi-season datasets, and benchmarks in LoWi.
* Reinforcement learning for navigation and interaction in dynamic, unpredictable scenarios.
* Data generation, augmentation, and active learning for the wild.
* Applications with a clear focus on long-term perception, learning, and navigation challenges.

## Submission guidelines

* We invite submissions of full papers of 4 to 8 pages, including references, formatted using the standard [IEEE RAS conference template](https://ras.papercept.net/conferences/support/tex.php).
* Submissions must present new, high-quality research on the workshop's themes.
* Submitted papers must not be under review or have been published in another archival venue.
* A double-blind peer-review process will be implemented. Papers will be evaluated based on their novelty, technical soundness, clarity, and relevance to the workshop.
* Accepted papers will be hosted on the workshop website but will not appear in the official IEEE Xplore proceedings, allowing for future submission to journals or major conferences.
* All accepted papers will be invited for either a spotlight oral or a poster presentation at the workshop.
* A selected number of high-quality papers will be invited to submit an extended version of their work to a special issue in a major journal. <!-- * The best submissions will be invited to submit a full-length paper in a Special Issue of the [IEEE Transactions on Field Robotics](https://www.ieee-ras.org/publications/t-fr). -->
* Papers should be submitted through the CMT portal: [**https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/LoWi2026**](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/LoWi2026)

## Awards and Travel Grants

Thanks to the generous support of our sponsors, we are pleased to announce the following awards and opportunities:
* We will present a **Best Student Presentation Award** and a **Best Presentation Award** to recognize outstanding contributions to the workshop. Winners will receive a certificate and a cash prize. The selection will be based on the quality of the paper and the presentation delivered during the workshop.
* We are committed to fostering diversity and inclusion within the robotics community. A limited number of **Travel Grants** are available to support student authors, with priority given to applicants from underrepresented regions or groups.
  - **Eligibility:** Student authors of accepted papers.
  - **Application:** Details on how to apply will be sent to authors upon paper acceptance.
